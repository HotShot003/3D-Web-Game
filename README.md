# 3D-Web-Game

Welcome to the 3D-Web-Game project! This project utilizes modern web technologies to create an immersive 3D web experience. 

The goal is to develop a third-person controller game with animations, physics, and movement using React Three Fiber, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Yarn is used for package management.

I am creating this project to understand Three.js and React Three Fiber.

## Project Overview

This project features:

- **3D Models**: Detailed character models and maps.
  
- **Movement and Physics**: Realistic movement and physics for a dynamic gaming experience.
  
- **React Three Fiber**: A powerful library for rendering 3D graphics in React.
  
- **Animations**: Smooth and responsive animations.

## About React Three Fiber

### What is React Three Fiber ?

React Three Fiber (R3F) is a React renderer for Three.js, which is a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. 

R3F provides a declarative way to build 3D scenes using React's component-based architecture, making it easier to manage complex 3D applications.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: With R3F, you can build 3D scenes using JSX, the same syntax you use for React components. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.
  
- **React Integration**: It seamlessly integrates with React, allowing you to use hooks, state, and lifecycle methods to control 3D objects.
  
- **Reusability**: React's component system promotes reusability, so you can create reusable 3D components.
  
- **Performance**: R3F leverages React's diffing algorithm to optimize updates to the 3D scene, ensuring good performance even with complex scenes.
  
- **Extensibility**: It supports Three.js plugins and custom shaders, giving you the flexibility to create advanced 3D graphics.

## Controls 

- A : For Moving in Left Direction

- D : For Moving in Right Direction

- S : For Moving BackWard Direction

- W : For Moving Ahead

- SPACE : For Jump

- SHIFT : For Run

- F : Hold F key To WAVE Hi
